# Fluent-Compact-Modern
Contains an XML file used for importing into OpenShell. Tried to match Startallback as best I could. 

### Requirements ###
Taskbar should be dark, Goto ``Settings`` in windows and change your theme and make your taskbar a darker color
**Openshell** - https://ninite.com/openshell/ninite.exe
Download and run ninite.exe it will automatically install openshell for you
**Fluent Skin for OpenShell ** - https://github.com/bonzibudd/Fluent-Refresh/releases/download/v1.6-beta.2/Fluent-Refresh_1.6b.2.zip


### Installation ###

Download the XML file

Extract the Fluent Files previously downloaded and play both files in the ``C:\Program Files\OpenShell\Skins`` folder

Right click the start menu then left click ``settings``
Click on the ``Skins`` tab
Select Fluent-Refresh_1.X
Now click the Arrow next to the Backup button at the bottom
Select ``Load from XML File`` and select the file you downloaded from this repository
Congrats! You've successfully setup a beautiful start menu!
